    After running assignta.py and gathering the summary table of our final non-dominated Pareto-optimal
solutions, we deemed our best solution to be found in row 5, reading "gabymari,0,1,0,0,30". When observing
this solution in comparison to the others, it becomes clear that it minimizes overallocation, conflicts,
undersupport, and unavailability in a way that is substantially better than others. Although initially it might
not seem ideal considering that the number of TAs allocated to a section they are "willing" to fill is not minimized
to the greatest degree, the minimization of the other factors stand out significantly.
    To describe in greater detail, all overallocation and conflict issues are eliminated entirely
