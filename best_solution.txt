    After running assignta.py and gathering the summary table of our final non-dominated Pareto-optimal
solutions, we deemed our best solution to be found in row 22, reading "gabymari,0,0,3,0,27". When observing
this solution in comparison to the others, it becomes clear that it minimizes overallocation, conflicts,
undersupport, unavailability, and preference in a way that is substantially better than others. Initially, it might
not seem ideal considering that undersupport is at 3, but all other issues in question are minimized the most while
offering some mitigation to the assignment of TAs to an unpreferred section.
    To describe in greater detail, all overallocation and conflict issues are eliminated entirely, both being at 0.
Undersupport is at a moderate count of 3, but this is mitigated by the fact that this allows for unpreferred
assignments to be at a reasonable level. Our runner-up for a best solution was found in row 5, reading
"gabymari,0,1,0,0,30". Although this solution keeps overallocation, undersupport, and unavailability at 0, the
number of TAs assigned preferred is greater than our chosen solution, indicating that it is not minimized the most
by this option. Both solutions stood out to us, but we ultimately decided on the solution found in row 22
due to its indication that TAs allocated to a section that is "unpreferred" to them is minimized in a way that
keeps most other objective names minimized at 0.
